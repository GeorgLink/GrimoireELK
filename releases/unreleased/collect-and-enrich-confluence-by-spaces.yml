    Users can collect and enrich Confluence data from specific spaces only,
    adding the option `--spaces=[SPACE1, SPACE2, ...]` to their `projects.json`.

    The following example shows how to collect and to enrich data from
    only the `DEV` and `SUPP` spaces only.
    ```
    {
        "project": {
            "confluence": [
                "http://example.com --spaces=[DEV, SUPP]"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
