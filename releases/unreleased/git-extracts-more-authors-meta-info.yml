    New information about the participants during the development and the
    reviewing processes are available in `Git` items. The Git backend extracts
    these data from `Approved-by`, `Co-authored-by`,  and `Merged-by`
    trailers that some commit messages might include. For each one of these
    trailers, new fields will be available with the suffixes: `_bots`, `_domains`,
    `_names`, `_org_names`, and `_uuids`. Also for each one of these suffixes,
    there will be extra fields with the prefix `non_authored_`.
    This is an example of the fields available for the the trailer `Merged-by`:
        - merged_by_multi_bots
        - merged_by_multi_domains
        - merged_by_multi_names
        - merged_by_multi_org_names
        - merged_by_multi_uuids
        - non_authored_merged_by_multi_bots
        - non_authored_merged_by_multi_domains
        - non_authored_merged_by_multi_names
        - non_authored_merged_by_multi_org_names
