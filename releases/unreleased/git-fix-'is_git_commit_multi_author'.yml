title: Git fix 'is_git_commit_multi_author'
category: fixed
author: Quan Zhou <quan@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
    This fixes the `is_git_commit_multi_author` field when the
    commit has more than one author and `pair-programming` is enabled.
    This is important for calculating `pair_programming_*` values.
