title: Poetry build version updated
category: fixed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  The current version of the `poetry` builder
  was old and caused some problems when installing
  packages in developer mode. With this
  new version, it's possible to install ELK in
  developer or editable mode without using
  `setuptools` files (i.e. `setup.cfg` and `setup.py`).
