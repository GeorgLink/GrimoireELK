title: Support to add identities to SortingHat from Enrich class
category: added
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>

notes: >
  New methods `add_identities` and `add_identity` are available
  on `Enrich` class to add new identities to a `SortingHat` database.
  Libraries using `elk` won't need to use `sortinghat` library to
  store new identities while enriching items.
