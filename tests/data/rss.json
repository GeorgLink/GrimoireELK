So, we decided to add our five cents, working over the weeks to bring some stats about women&#8217;s contribution to Linux Kernel.</p>\n<p>Before diving deep into our results, let\u2019s take a look at some data we already have from the tech sector. Women represent:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2960\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>30-40% of tech companies workforce</li>\n<li>10-20% of tech teams</li>\n<li>5% of CEO positions</li>\n<li>21% of middle level/roles</li>\n<li>32% of junior roles</li>\n<li>11% of OpenStack population, <a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/2016/04/25/openstack-genderdiversity-technical-contributions-analysis/\">according to our previous analysis</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Women&#8217;s contribution to Linux Kernel</strong></p>\n<p>Analyzing git activity and population, <strong>women are 9,9% of the population and responsable for 6,8% of the activity</strong>. But last year, despite the woman population has increased by 2 points, the contribution has only boosted 1,5 more.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3011\" style=\"width: 1792px;\"><img alt=\"Women git committers evolution\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3011\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/git-authors-women-in-linux.jpg?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evolution of women committers to Linux git</p></div>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3014\" style=\"width: 1764px;\"><img alt=\"Commits by women to Linux git\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3014\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/git-commits-women-in-linux.jpg?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evolution of commits done by women to Linux git</p></div>\n<p>Trend evolution has maintained over the years, but there are two peaks in 2014 and 2016.

Merging code reviews are acked by women in a 3%-10%</strong>.</p>\n<p>Woman population in Linux Kernel was boosted by 110 developers in 2014 and 2015.</p>\n<p>We have also analysed community demography (how contributors join and leave), especially women. In fact, we have discovered that <strong>in 2013, 64 developers did their first commit to the Linux Kernel project, but 35 left during following semester</strong>, and just 12 are still contributing. It\u2019s a good idea to build a kinder environment in developers communities in order to retain more people, especially women.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_3018\" style=\"width: 1436px;\"><img alt=\"Women doing 1st commit to Linux Kernel by semester\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3018\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/first-commit-authors-women-in-linux.jpg?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Women doing 1st commit to Linux Kernel by semester</p></div>\n<p><strong>Conclusions and Potential Actions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Diversity is important</strong>. There are several reasons for that, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nithyaruff\">Nithya Ruff</a>\u00a0said in LinuxCon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/sex_discrimination/publication/CEDAW/CEDAW_complete.pdf\">Human Rights question</a>. Technology assumption allows empowerment and reduce the gender tech gap. Technology is running the world and is unfair to exclude any part of the population, such as women.</li>\n<li>Diversity brings better economic results to firms. As many studies have published, diversity is correlated to better benefit results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have discovered so many threads during the research, finding a correlation between gender initiatives in tech industries and the growing number of women.</p>\n<p>To close the article, we would encourage Linux Foundation in all gender initiatives which they are performing, with the strong believe that they are building a better world.</p>\n<p>You can join the <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/bitergia/gender-diversity-analysis-of-the-linux-kernel-technical-contributions\">full presentation</a> that Daniel Izquierdo performed, and <strong>if you are interested in running or sponsoring similar analysis for other communities or projects, just <a href=\"mailto:info@bitergia.com\">let us know</a>!</strong></p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2960/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2960/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.bitergia.com&#038;blog=32615158&#038;post=2960&#038;subd=bitergia&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />"

The use of bots to do research and to send messages are two practices not overly valued by developers.</p>\n<p>GitHub, StackOverflow and LinkedIn are the most popular resources for tech recruiters nowadays. Despite them being great sources of information, recruiters don\u2019t know how to use them and have a lot of difficulties capturing the\u00a0developers attention.</p>\n<p>One of the most common\u00a0mistakes is to try to measure someone\u2019s knowledge by using simple metrics like the number of contributions, lines of code, etc., that they have in projects, or their <em>karma</em> in StackOverflow.</p>\n<p>Beyond GitHub and StackOverflow, there are many other tools like Bugzilla, Gerrit, Jira, etc., used by a lot of projects to manage their development and recruiters are losing out on its potential use for improving their talent search.</p>\n<p>Moreover, developers stay updated by reading books and free online tutorials, training through online courses, engaging social and professional networks, participating in open meet-ups and attending conferences. This kind of activity describes what skills a developer has and what kind of technologies they are interested in.</p>\n<p>When a software project manager or recruiter is looking for a developer, it\u2019s not only about the technology they manage, it\u2019s also about the the resilience, critical thought, and problem solving orientation.</p>\n<p><strong>Coders searching for coders</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitergia.com/products/dashboards/\">Bitergia Dashboards</a> presents an up to date, high level, quantitative panoramic view of the ecosystem involved in project development, with the ability to drill into data and metrics what matter most for the user.</p>\n<p>In terms of <em>talent search</em> and <em>talent retention</em>, Bitergia customizes the dashboard for recruiters and <abbr title=\"Human Resources\">HR</abbr> managers to provide specific metrics and queries.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say company <em>ACME</em> is using <abbr title=\"Software Defined Network\">SDN</abbr> technologies and it is looking for developers for its <abbr>IT</abbr> team, so, where could they look ?

                "value": "<p>To celebrate 25 years of Linux kernel development, we at <a href=\"http://bitergia.com\">Bitergia</a> have produced the <a href=\"http://linux.biterg.io\">Linux development history dashboard</a>. This dashboard visualizes the current Linux git repository from two points of view: the history of all commits (changes to the source code) up to now, and the history of all lines in the current version. The dashboard visualizes the main parameters about the development (the who, when and what) are visualized, and allows for drilling down in the data, for example finding the specific commits that lead to a specific part of the code.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"linux-dashboard-blame\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2732\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/linux-dashboard-blame.png?w=480\" /></p>\n<p>Do you want to learn about when the lines in the current kernel were authored? Who has participated in specific areas of the kernel? How many files have remain untouched for more than 10 years? Play with the dashboard and find your own interesting details!</p>\n<p>The dashboard was produced using only free, open source software tools (among them, <a href=\"http://grimoirelab.github.io\">GrimoireLab</a>, our tookit for software development analytics). If you want to learn more details, check the <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/jgbarah/authorship-dashboard-for-the-linux-kernel\">slides I intended to use for my presentation at LinuxCon</a>, which unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t attend. Those provide some more insight about how it was produced, some examples about how it can be used, and some curiosities found by exploring it.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2717\"></span></p>\n<p>Playing with the dashboard is easy. Click almost anywhere, and you get a filter for that parameter. For example, if you click on the name of a developer, you get a filter which will produce only lines authored by that person. The filter is a green button, on the top right, which can be applied, negated, or deleted. Or combined with further filters, just by clicking on new parameters.</p>\n<p>For facilitating the analysis of the history of the current Linux kernel, we have prepared three panels, based on visualizing the output of the &#8220;git blame&#8221; command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Git Blame basic panel, which shows mainly tables with different views of the lines in the current kernel (authors, files, commits, directories, file extensions, time zones), any of which can be used as a filter. Using it, for example, you can explore in which directories a certain developer has contributed, and with which specific pattern. For example, the next screenshot shows the results of this panel after filtering the activity of a single developer (just by clicking on his name in the authors table).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Selection_026\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2753\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/selection_026.png?w=480\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git Blame (Files). The basic Git Blame panel was oriented to lines, while this panel is oriented to files. Here you can find information about when files were last edited, when the first line in the current version of the kernel was authored, or for how long a file has been evolving. For example, the screenshot below shows the number of files according to certain time parameters (such as the number of years since the first line still remaining in the file, or since the last change to the file).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Selection_028\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2770\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/selection_028.png?w=480\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git Blame (Charts). Shows a summary of the information, but using charts instead of tables. The next screenshot shows, as an example, the result of filtering the files with extension &#8220;.c&#8221; in the directory net/bluetooth</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Selection_027\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2764\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/selection_027.png?w=480\" /></p>\n<p>Then, we provide also more classical panels with the commits history (visualizations of the &#8220;git log&#8221; output), which can be explored as well to learn about how the Linux kernel development has evolved over time.</p>\n<p>This is a brief description of our present to anyone interested in how Linux was produced. We&#8217;re still fixing and improving the data, let us know if you find any bug, or know about how to improve it!</p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2717/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2717/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.bitergia.com&#038;blog=32615158&#038;post=2717&#038;subd=bitergia&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />"

Backlogs are quite useful for this purpose, either using Kanban and directly having a look at the open issues waiting lists project by project as in the case of GitHub, or using any other manual or automated method.</p>\n<p>For this engineering focus we have started to produce some panels whose main purpose is to help developers to make decisions. As this is still in its first stages there is room for improvement, but this hopefully shows how powerful this could be. The displayed panel is part of the <a href=\"https://dashboard.bitergia.com/coreos/\">open analytics panel</a> produced for the <a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/\">CoreOS community</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2584\" style=\"width: 490px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/?attachment_id=2584#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2584\"><img alt=\"backlog_panel_coreos\" class=\"wp-image-2584 size-large\" height=\"231\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/backlog_panel_coreos.png?w=480&#038;h=231\" width=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">CoreOS Pull Requests / Issues Backlog panel</p></div>\n<p>This panel aims at providing information at three main levels:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2583\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Current situation of the backlog</strong>. This can be mainly visualized in the top two tables working as a summary for the pull requests and issues in GitHub together with the big table that contains information about each of the open issues. The links to the actual ticket in the various GitHub repositories can also be seen. This example displays aggregated information for all of the projects found in GitHub for the CoreOS organization. That means that you do not need to navigate through all of the projects to have an aggregated view of the entire project. Indeed, it is possible to filter by project, submitter, period of time or even type of community (CoreOS or Community in this case) to drill down to the required project or community member.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2586\" style=\"width: 490px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/?attachment_id=2586#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2586\"><img alt=\"detail_backlog_coreos\" class=\"wp-image-2586 size-large\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/detail_backlog_coreos.png?w=480&#038;h=299\" width=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Detail of the CoreOS backlog</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical debt</strong> (let me extrapolate this concept!) in terms of the accumulated time that the issues or pull requests have remained open in the project. The two bar charts in the top right display the same history, but with a different metric. The first table at the top shows information about the current backlog of open issues and pull requests (this can also be filtered thanks to Kibana capabilities). And this is counting issues per period of time. The second bar chart displays the accumulated time for all of the issues still open in that activity timeframe. Having this in mind helps to understand why there are peaks in the second bar chart: the older a pull request or an issue is, the more time they accumulate without being closed.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2588\" style=\"width: 490px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/?attachment_id=2588#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2588\"><img alt=\"detail_backlog_acc_time\" class=\"wp-image-2588 size-large\" height=\"262\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/detail_backlog_acc_time.png?w=480&#038;h=262\" width=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Detail on the current situation of the backlog (top) and accumulated open time (down)</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The community behind such backlog</strong> as submitters and assigned organizations. The two remaining charts, the table and the pie chart at the bottom right of the panel displays information about the submitters and the organizations assigned to fix those issues and pull requests. This helps to make a difference when working with communities oriented to non-hired developers, helping them to progress in the project as soon as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2589\" style=\"width: 490px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/?attachment_id=2589#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2589\"><img alt=\"detail_backlog_community_coreos\" class=\"wp-image-2589 size-large\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/detail_backlog_community_coreos.png?w=480&#038;h=196\" width=\"480\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Detail of the community around the backlog</p></div>\n<p>As a summary, this panel helps to understand the current backlog through three main concepts: <strong>the community, the accumulated open time of the issues and the list of open issues and pull requests</strong>. As mentioned, this was done for the CoreOS community, but we&#8217;re also working on adding other data sources. Jira and Bugzilla are two of those that are already supported and with their own panels to display this very same information.</p>\n<p>The panels displayed in the CoreOS dashboard are available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/grimoirelab/panels\">panels project</a> under the <a href=\"https://github.com/grimoirelab\">GrimoireLab</a> organization in GitHub.</p>\n<p>As usual, feedback is more than welcome!</p><br />  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2583/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/bitergia.wordpress.com/2583/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.bitergia.com&#038;blog=32615158&#038;post=2583&#038;subd=bitergia&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" />"

It\u2019s part of the job to elaborate reports with multiple metrics on community health for example. But, measuring should be an effective task.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in mind, I\u2019d like to share with you 5 reasons about why community managers or <a href=\"https://blog.bitergia.com/2016/06/08/turning-metrics-and-insights-into-relevant-information-not-only-for-community-managers/\">any other professional related with software development</a> should have a dashboard that provides all the data about the community or project that she/he manages:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2369\"></span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t want to <em>waste</em> your time on gathering and processing data.</strong>\n<p>If your role is to manage a community, your main activities should be related with <a href=\"https://opensource.com/business/16/3/why-community-managers-must-wade-not-dive-communities\" target=\"_blank\">wading (not diving) into community</a>: listen and talk to the community and get it engaged, not to spend too much time trying to get data from several data sources, but taking decisions based on the data. Getting <strong>a tool can help you to minimize the time wasted on collecting all the data and to be focus</strong> on your activity.</li>\n<li><strong>All community data in one place.</strong>\n<p>Sofwtare development communities use a bunch of different tools, and <strong>it&#8217;s hard to get valuable aggregated metrics from many of them</strong>. There are <a href=\"https://bitergia.com/products/dashboards/\">open source analytic tools in the market</a> to help companies and communities to put all the data in one place, so everyday you can take a look and have an overview on the big numbers on basic metrics (like <a href=\"https://opensource.com/business/15/12/top-5-open-source-community-metrics-track\" target=\"_blank\">size, demographics, performance, activity, diversity</a>). A dashboard that shows activity and metrics about source code, tickets/issues, code review, discussions, chats, continuous integration, and downloads, provides a first view of how much the community is doing, and can be used to track different kinds of activity, and allow you to drill down into the details.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1832\" style=\"width: 524px;\"><img alt=\"bitergia-data-sources\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1832\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bitergia-data-sources.png?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some development communities tools</p></div></li>\n<li><strong>Profile your community participants and contributors.</strong>Having a dashboard where you can get quickly metrics related with community growth, community attraction, engagement,&#8230; is an <strong>easy way to identify who is joining, and key and emerging contributors</strong>.\n<p>But <strong>it also shows who is participating less</strong> before he/she leaves the community. Maybe you want to send an email to ask if everything is ok and try to find out why the participation is decreasing, it could be personal reasons or something that had that person stacked at some point. But <strong>you need the data in advance to anticipate any issue</strong>.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_2486\" style=\"width: 2410px;\"><img alt=\"Community git Contributions\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2486\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/community-git-contributions.jpg?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Community git contributions</p></div></li>\n<li><strong>Overall processes performance of the community. Measure quantity and quality.</strong>It highlights issues and bottlenecks, allowing them to be resolved before they grow or spread. You can analyze how processes are performing. For example, you can measure how long processes take to finish; time to resolve or close tickets shows how the project is reacting to new information that requires action; time spent in code review.\n<p>Not all is about if a number grows, probably you want to have insights on contributors&#8217; profiling and quality participation, and that is revealed in the sum-total of other metrics and data.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_2346\" style=\"width: 3202px;\"><img alt=\"Last 2 years Gerrit backlog, from one of our WiP projects\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2346\" src=\"https://bitergia.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/gerrit-backlog.jpg?w=480\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Last 2 years Gerrit backlog, from one of our WiP projects</p></div></li>\n<li><strong>Trends over the time.</strong>It&#8217;s not only what is happening today, it is what is happening over the time and the evolution of your community. Which was the diversity of the community two years ago compared with last month on the code review process? The answers to that kind of question provides important information about the evolution and work done in the community. But not only that, people evolve over the time and contributors do it too. We can closely see how a contributor changes his/her role over the time, for example, from active code contributor to a management profile, but only if you have data from several source that allows you to do that analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All these things are easier if you have a <a href=\"https://bitergia.com/products/dashboards/\">dashboard</a> that provides all that data aggregated that let you filter and drill down into details. It would let you focus in your job: to manage the community and stay connected to them, and <strong>don\u2019t waste time trying to gather all the data</strong>.
