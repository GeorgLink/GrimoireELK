Core is essentially done.  I've made a pass through\nthe Postorius, HyperKitty, and mailmanclient milestones and there's not a lot\nleft, but both of the former two could probably use some help getting to the\nfinish line.  I'm going to spend some time on mailmanclient.  gitlab.com is\ndown right now so I can't provide any links.\n\n>Furthermore, I wonder if either of the two following projects have been\n>proposed for Google Summer of Code applications:\n>\n>1) the afore mentioned comprehensive install script for Mailman3 on various\n>targeted hardware; and/or;\n\nWe've been debating about the best way to do this, and right now the only\nthing we can agree on is that mailman-bundler needs to go away. ;)\n\nWe know we want distro packages, but that's a longer term prospect.  I suspect\nwe want some container-based deployment options too, and I know that there are\nseveral dockerfiles floating around, but none are currently blessed\nofficially.  It's possible we won't have one single official deploy method,\nbut instead we'll encourage experimentation and help to promote the best\noptions in the short term, perhaps with adoption in the longer term.  I don't\nhave a more solid answer than that, but I highly encourage anybody who has an\ninterest in this to come to mailman-developers@ and help us get there.\n\n>2) updated for Python 3 and the latest P3 compatible Django utilities for\n>archiving and email list collection, along with any new appropriate features?\n\nThat's a great question for the Postorius and HyperKitty folks.  Core is\nPython 3 already (and only), while P and HK should support both on Django.\nmailmanclient is and will remain bilingual.\n\n>Many thanks in advance for all your efforts in this extremely worthwhile OSS\n>project.\n\nThank!  We have a small team of core developers, but they are really awesome.\nAnd of course, we welcome new contributors!\n\nCheers,\n-Barry"
