        "Event Creations": "Many of our creations for that event were on pen and paper, so we'll share photos of them.\n\nOur creations for the day were:\n  * Flipchart categorizing favorite stories from learners as comedies or dramas.\n  * Story curves from learners (both dramas and comedies).\n  * Script sampe from learners with original stories.\n  * Collaborative story sheets from groups for narrative brainstorming.\n  \n  Sample Thimble Make with script from learner: https://thimbleprojects.org/neogrew/55179/",
        "Event Description": "We're on a batch of events focused on what we call \"the videologger/youtuber\" curriculum. Our learners surfaced the desire to learn how to create their own online video channels. To fill the need for this collection of video making digital skills, we begun experimenting with events focused on providing cinematography skills adapted to online video context and their own local context. This was our second event in this collection and was focused on narrative structure and scriptwriting.\n\nWe begun the day explaining about classical narrative structure which is divided in just two formats, comedy and drama, and how every single movie they know will fall into one category or another. We explained the nature of each format and their flow and turning points. After this we did a micro-activity where they used sticky notes to write down movie/cartoon/series names and fix them to the comedy or drama sections of our flipchart. As they acquired a new comprehension about story formats we proceeded to discuss about turning points and how they apply to their favorite stories - books, movies, series - it was very lively, specially when we spoke about the hero's journey and the parallels between harry potter, star wars and hercules.\n\nWith that base knowledge set, we invited everyone to create their own story structure with a starting point, two turning points and an ending scenario. Each one created both a drama and a comedy. This was done with story curves done on printer paper with markers. We then did some little show and tell with learners walking around the venue presenting their stories to each other. That actually happened spontaneously as they finished their stories at different times and started showing them to others who also had completed their stories.\n\nAfter having this story format understood, we focused on scriptwriting. We begun with an explanation of a simplified movie script format which they were able to follow using a Thimble Make with a script sample. They learned about how scenes, actions, descriptions and dialogues are written in a movie script and proceeded to remix that Thimble Make with the script sample. The idea was to pick the story they created on our first activity and write two scenes from it. We saw a lot of engagement on this activity as well. As they completed their script sample, a new gallery walk occured with learners showing each other their creations.\n\nOur final activity for the day was one focused on brainstorming new stories. It was a little group dynamic where the learners were divided in groups of four. Each group received a sheet of paper with columns labeled - who, did what, with whom and where - each learner in a group would fill a single column and fold that column backwards to keep its content hidden before passing to the next learner. In the end we read all the stories aloud and had a lot of fun with the absurd creations.\n\nTo close our day we did a little health check dynamic where we asked our learners to place the first word that came to their mind when thinking about Rio Mozilla Club and place it on a shared flipchart. We're using this to gauge their emotions towards the club and the feedback has been great.\n\nA special thing that happened during this event is that we were joined by a group of university students from a design course who are researching digital inclusion and web literacy with the aim of creating a term project that could help any social program in that area. They not only joined our event as observers but also engaged in some of the activities including providing the explanation about the hero's journey to the learners. It was awesome.\n\nAs usual, our events always end with lunch and group photo. Learners already want us back there.",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "Attendees are really enjoying our videologger series, they are engaged and anxious for the next events. Even some of the activities that focused on stuff that they don't enjoy much such as writing were received really well. We always do a metrics dynamic where we learn what they enjoyed from that day, what didn't worked for them and what they would enjoy seeing in the future, the most voiced opinion on the second column (what a pity/what didn't work) is that they'd like longer events (PS: our events last at least 3 hours).\n  \n  YouTubers are the new stars of this generation. As we unlock in them the skills needed to join the videologging activities and participate on this community, we also empower them with the leadership and organizational skills needed for future online civic participation as videos are a powerful online political tool here.",

We did this activity to get everybody excited about learning about movies and also which were the favorites so that we could use them as an examples for the rest of the day.\n\n## Discovering the various camera shot sizes\n\nThe first activity was explaining the various camera shot sizes used by cinema. After the explanation, we divided the club into groups and each group created a sequence of plans for a story happening within the venue itself.\n\nTo help them understanding this activity, we made a first set of shot plans together and then split into groups. This activity was carried out with markers and paper.\n\n## Discovering the camera positions\nThe next step was to talk about the various camera angles and positions. We then asked them to remix the story from the previous activity with new angles and positions.\n\n## Telling a story through photos\nThe final activity of the day was the creation of a kind of comic book where various groups used their mobile phones to take pictures using the various angles, positions and types of camera plans they learned and use them to tell a story.\n\n## Conclusion\nWe ended our day with the usual routine lunch, metrics and group photo. Everyone was very excited to continue learning from our YouTuber curriculum.\n\n",

        "Event Description": "We are currently learning how to search for items  and how to verify the sources from which we get those items while browsing the web. For this, we undertook Kraken The Code, led by our club captains, Michelle and Sharon. We started by writing on Post-It notes, all the sources we use when searching for things. Once we had exhausted, we pinned together all the similar sources and discussed why we thought those sources were good. Some of the reasons included cheap access, fast loading of the web pages,accuracy of info, encryption messages on the messaging sites and personal preference.  We also discussed why we thought some sites were untrustworthy and some of the reasons were that the presence of numerous uncalled for Ads, false/inaccurate info and even info that has not been updated in such a long while.\nFrom there, we undertook the Legit-o-meter activity to prove whether the Kraken is real or just a myth. However, in place of Kraken, we slotted in one of our local Kenyan legends called Lwanda Magere so that we could better understand the concept. In groups of two, we browsed two different sites per group, citing the URL and writing when the post was written, what the writing style was, whether the site required us to buy items and at the end we would rate the reliability of that site.\nWe then set up stands that represented what we truly thought of Lwanda; whether our legend, was \"Real\" , \"Imaginary\" or \"In Between.\" Most of us believed that Lwanda was just a myth. With this, we were able to now decipher sources of information that could be trusted and those that could not be trusted.\n\n",

This session was about me (the club captain) getting to know the girls, and helping them and myself feel comfortable with one another. I also briefed the girls on what the Mozilla Project is about ad the purpose of having the club. Furthermore, I could give them insight on what they could expect from the upcoming sessions. I would say that this was the most important session because I could establish a good relationship with the girls, and get to understand their abilities and knowledge regarding the web. This helped me to set a visual image on how I could plan for the next sessions, by knowing how basic or in-depth I should go with lesson plans. The session also helped the girls feel comfortable speaking to one another, and sharing their excitement of what they expect from this club. We have also established that we (the girls and myself) are KIKA'S. Our clubs name is the Kika Club, and I aim to empower the girls to view themselves as powerful and \"kickass\" (deriving from our clubs name). I look forward to the next session, when we start using the event material and having a practical and participating event.",

The best experiences are the one\u2019s that remain in their minds etched forever. Those experiences give the students a sense of immense pleasure whenever they think about it. It is these experiences that help them in their future. \nThis event was one such opportunity for the young minds where they did learn different nuances of how to do web search, navigate, explore information and use those information while blogging. \nIn India, many stereotype career options coexist where you can be successful only if you are a doctor or an engineer, but we tried to prove otherwise in an awesome way. Our aim delves deep in enthusing them about content writing, blogging, e-book writing and lot of creative activities. We strive to make them understand that this is a wonder world, which is no less than the conventional professions like medical or engineering. We analysed the importance of blogging and defined how a Mozilla Club like Indus Youniverse can help them in accomplishing the mission.\nWe went on to share the blueprint on how Indus will help the students to shape up their careers if they want to take up content writing or blogging as their career options. No sooner did I start speaking, than I found the students hooked on to this interesting and rather new topic. The computer lab suddenly became a multiplex and I could see the enthralling crowd glued to my words with all ears.",

A word that brings a lot of questions in your mind, a lot of thoughts in your mind\u2026 And to answer it all here we had Subhasis Chatterjee sir who taught us all it meant. Sir taught us Blogging \u2013 its features, the techniques and the processes involved. It all was truly amazing.\n\nAyut Ghosh: A day well spent. I would also like to give a big thanks to our school authorities for giving the permission to make time for this interactive session with Indus. I learnt a lot of interesting and unknown facts about Mozilla Firefox and its upcoming venture of globalizing the Firefox browser in different languages.

They also got to learn about how to do the research in search engine and take out the required information.\n\nThe second half was actually meant for giving them an idea of the various interesting career options after their academic career gets over.

It is a school at a town which is some 51 kms away from Kolkata by road. If you connect it by train, it'll take around one hour forty five minutes.\nI discussed on different web literacy skills and how those acquired skills can be utilized in different career options. The students attended the session were mostly from class IX & X. So they took active interest in it and enjoyed. They seemed to be very enthusiastic as they were asking lot of questions in between. ",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "Got a feedback from the Computer teacher & the school headmistress that the students attended the session really got to know a lot of new things. They've subsequently requested the school authorities to arrange many more sessions of this kind.",

We started off the session with \"chatting\" about issues that women/girls face in their daily environments, and also relating it to the web and how these issues are escalated on the web when it comes to the girls. \n\nWe then did a activity on how to use the web as a source of learning. The girls wrote down on a poster what they would like to learn to do or gain knowledge about, and how they want to gain this. Most wanted to use the internet to go about doing this, and we could then all establish that the internet is a place where we can share ideas and information.\n\nWe then briefly discussed how the internet works. The girls could then acknowledge that the things we do not see that are happening in the background are very important, and was quite amazed as to all those things that happen and how quickly we get the tons of information back from one request. \n\nThe session was really fun because we could interact quite well with one another and we could learn so many things without us having to use a physical internet connection.

        "Event Description": "This was the first session for Mozilla club Inkwenkwezi. Mozilla Club Inkwenkwezi is based in Dr N.R Mandela high school located in Crossroads township. In total the club is made up of 15 grade 9 girls.\n\nWe started the session by doing a name game, with the the aim of getting to know each other prior to starting the session. Each person during the session had to think of an object that has a name that starts with a letter that is the same as that of an individual's first name. At first an individual had to introduce themselves by saying for example, \"Peach- for Pozisa\". On second round we all had to repeat the object and the person's name while they remain quite.\n\nThe second part of the session we discussed their short term career goals, that is what they were planning to major in when they are doing grade 10. The discussion helped me to have some knowledge of challenges they are encountering, such as difficulty of some subjects, which can be a determinant for subject areas they will choose in grade 10. In our discussion I tried to provide solutions to some problems they are encountering. The solutions include helping them to search on YouTube for educational videos, for the subjects they are struggling with. I also taught them searching the web for tutorials or exercises for the subjects they are doing.\n\nThe third task involved a slide presentation whereby I was teaching them about the history of the web. In that session we covered what is the web, who coined it, what are the types of the web and also covered the major section, which is why we are studying the web. On a second session I will do recap on this section, just to ensure that they have solid theoretical foundation of the concept.\n\nThe forth task was when they opened their own Gmail accounts. I had to assist they in opening the accounts. Since most of them have never had Gmail accounts before, I had to open a Gmail account for Mozilla Club Inkwenkwezi ( clubinkwenkwezi@gmail.com), which they had to use as a \"previous account\", which is required when one is opening a Gmail account.\n\nThe last part of the session involved them writing \"when do they learn best\" and \"when do they not learn best\" on sticky notes. The feedback they gave me, will help me to better structure the content for the next session.\n\nOverall remarks! The event was awesome, I really enjoyed myself with the kids and they also enjoyed themselves. I am looking forward to the next session with them!",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "The kids enjoyed the session, they were actually pushing me to do more even though I was scared for their safety. They were participating and gave their all to ensuring that the first session was a great success.",

        "Event Description": "This was an exciting event, as always. It is always amazing to meet up with the girls and teach them something new which they can use in their lives. The most amazing thing is that one ends up learning a lot from the kids. The event was started with an energizer called Jump in Jump Out. The ice breaker was fun, and the kids enjoyed it. It made them to be awake!!\n\nThe first thing that was done in this event was to recap on the previous event lesson which was to introduce the history of the web. I tried to engage them, and help them understand what is the web and why is it important for us to learn about. Most importantly, to learn how to use the web.\n\nThe next activity was focused on creating email addresses for those 11 learners who were absent on the previous event. It was a challenge to open emails for them since most of them did not have cell phones or some had left them at home. It was a challenge because Google required their accounts to be verified based on the cell numbers they have provided. However, we came up with a plan that the following week they would have to inform whoever is left at home to text me (the mentor) their verification codes once they have received them , so that we can verify the accounts.\n\nLastly, we made them watch two videos, one which was on history of the web and the last one was on security. After each video we had time for asking each individual what they have learnt from the video lesson/s. Some cooperated, but some were shy to share their ideas of what they learnt with the group.",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "The learners were so excited about the event. They want us to spend at least two hours in our sessions instead of an hour. They are looking forward to more practical activities instead theory",

We then proceeded to the Kraken the code activity and this helped the learners to learn about search terms, keywords, and how to assess the validity and relevance of web sources. Learners concluded into groups by some saying that the kraken was real, something in between or imaginary. They also learnt about how to search  informations on google since some of them were really young but basically the girls were excited and can't wait to see what the whole package of Mozilla clubs has in store for them ",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "Before the activity, none of the learners knew how to assess the validity and relevance of web sources but they were glad at the end that they now know how to do that as some of them shared by concluding on how to do that, mentioning it is important to know the author, if the site is well designed, spell checks, sources etc and they promised to share it with their friends and loved ones. They also loved the fact that they were able to research about the Kraken to know if it was real, imaginary or something in between and this really made them think and also they loved the icebreaker which made them laugh a lot and the videos that was showed to them on girls coding and that really inspired them.

The content was discussed on how to do a search and aligning it with what was taught in the previous session on what the web looks like and how different networks work together. The session ended off with discussion on different issues that the girls wanted to address about how they perceive the web and their use thereof. This gave the club captain a good understanding on how the participants think about different things. What was gathered from this discussion is that many of the girls are aware of the dangers of the web but are not knowledgeable on how it can be addressed. ",

        "Event Description": "Our session started off with 'Girl Chat'. We discussed issues that is evident in our communities and country pertaining to girls. The one issue that was risen, was about the afro hair style that was in headline news in our country at Pretoria High School. We did a search for local news on the issue and watched a video that highlighted the main issues that took place. The girls and I could share our sentiments about what took place there and how we would feel if it were to happen to us. I could also encourage the girls that we should feel comfortable about our natural beauty and to not let anyone define limits to what we should look like. \n\nAfter our 'Girl Chat', our session was about design and accessibility of the web. We did a little brainstorm on what our ideas was when we heard the words 'design' and 'accessibility'. After we had gathered this we did an activity that portrayed theses ideas. The activity started off with the girls doing a drawing about anything that came to their minds when thinking about creativity. I tried to get them to steer towards our 'Girl Chat', and what their feelings were about it. Thereafter, each girl posted their sticky note with their image on the big poster. We could then identify that it was all a mess and had no meaning to it, and with that we then rearranged the images to make more sense and put a title to it.\n\nWhat the girls have learned from this session is that your design has to be made in the sense that others can relate to it and make sense of it, as well has can use it for future reference once they understand what it is about. \n\nThe session was then concluded, and the girls had fun being able to interact with one another. This activity was done on paper base.",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "\"I really enjoyed todays session and look forward to see how we are going to apply what we did today onto the web in our next session\"\n\n\"I learned alot today about how we can make our simple design or idea about something meaningful, so that others can use it\"\n\n\"Todays session was fun. I like that we can speak about issues that we face in our sessions and get advice from our club captain and the other girls.\"",

        "Event Description": "We decided to create an email address with Gmail for the girls and ended up teaching them how to do that too, which they had to open email addresses for one another. This, we did because we noticed most of the girls don't have an email address because they were too young and then also because during our last activity which was hack the news, in other for them to actually publish their remixing they needed to have an email address. So in general girls were excited that they could actually create email addresses in minutes and they can help anyone be it their family members or friends to create email addresses for one another.\nAnother success was that they actually remixed news sites with interesting contents, images and actually publish it for anyone to see.",

        "Event Description": "This session was led by ladies from Every1 Mobile, Sellina and Kuye.\nThe Every1 Mobile ladies when teaching the web, engaged with the learners. They gave the learners autonomy, in their learning process. This made it possible for the learners to come out of their comfort zone. It gave them freedom to learn freely and enabled them to assist their peers who were struggling.\n\nClub Inkwenkwezi was afforded the opportunity to learn web literacy skills, ranging from searching, connecting on the web, web protection, and web contribution. Prior to commencing with the session for that day, the learners were expected to type the URL code, which was going to lend them on the My Mozilla club website. This was fascinating, because it taught them important things, such as ensuring that all letters and characters of a URL code were typed correctly, in order for one to lend to a correct page. For some learners, typing the URL code correctly was like \u2018a walk in the park\u2019. Those who managed to finish quickly, assisted their peers to type the URL code correctly.\n\nFurthermore, the learners were also introduced to an activity, that enabled them to contribute on the web. They had to write their thoughts on certain topics, such as cyber-bullying. The activity enabled the learners to gain some insight on what cyber-bullying is and how it affects them as young people living in the digital age. It also aided them to gain information on how to remain safe when engaging in online platforms.\n\nOverall, the learners and their club captain, were excited by the visit. The visit helped the club to cover a handful of web literacy skills, which was a great benefit for club. In future, the club captain is hoping to use the My Mozilla club website, to further enhance, the skills of the young ladies in club Inkwenkwezi",

        "Event Description": "This event was mainly dedicated to expanding further on lessons the kids learnt in previous session about cyber-bullying. For the session I prepared a poster. I used the poster for giving the learners a picture of what cyber-bullying can be described as. They were requested to analyse the picture and interpret according to their own views, what they thought cyber-bullying entailed. Some of the learners attempted to give me answers, and some of the answers were very good. After finishing the first activity, we moved to the next one, which was watching two videos.\n\nWhat I liked about the videos is that they were presented in cartoons. The learners liked them a lot, they were even laughing throughout the duration of the videos. But I had to keep them focused because the content was more important than the cartoons.The first video they watched, helped to explain in simple terms, cyber-bullying. The second one helped to provide them with tips on how to be safe when using social media platforms. It did that by providing them with do's and don's when on social media.\n\nAfter watching the videos, the learners had to seat in groups of maximum five people. In those groups, they were given topics, which they were expected to discuss as groups. When they were done with their discussions, they had to elect someone to present their findings. It was interesting to see them working together, sharing ideas and advising each other on what they should present. I was also thrilled  to see, their excellent presentation skills. I must say I am proud of them!",

        "Event Description": "Club Phoenix had its first session. We started off with ice breakers to create an free environment for the girls. I then explained what teaching the web was about and the importance of the program. We then talked about the web and the internet to have an understanding of how the web works and the different components that are involved. After that, I asked the girls a few questions to get an understanding of how well they were understanding the web. The feedback was good; the girls had a good understanding of what the web was about.\n\nWhen we finished discussing the web, we short break were we did a team building activity. This activity was to show the girls the importance of team work and communication. The girls enjoyed the activity and were ready for the next session. We then started with \"reading the web\". We talked about how to search the web, how to identify reliable information on the web, what makes a reliable source on the web. \n\nThe girls learned a lot from the session (the internet, how to read the web) and were eager for club phoenix to have another session. What makes my club special are games that we play to get to know each other as well as the videos that are played during the session to give the girls a better understanding of concepts and certain topics. These videos are more clear and give the girls a better picture of what will be discussed.",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "The attendees said they learned a lot from the session we had. They had a better understanding of what the web was about and the different devices used to access the web using the internet. When asked if they would like to have another session, they replied with a bold yes.",

        "Event Description": "My group, Mozilla Club Inkwenkwezi, was blessed to be part of the Africa Code Week, along with Kika Mozilla club. This was an exciting time for my group, since they were going to learn some basic coding skills, using a free programming language, Scratch.\n\nThe event was divided into different sessions, which were presented by different professionals who were present on that day. Some helped in explaining the purpose of Africa Code Week to the learners and why it was important for them to be part of the programme. Others focused on providing the kids with basic background on what programming entails, using simple life examples. For example, one girl who had volunteered to be used as an example for explaining the term, was asked to dance. After she finished dancing, the professional asked the class to help in writing instructions, which were to be given to the girl so that she can repeat the same dance moves over and over. Ultimately, the instructions the class gave did not result into what they thought they were going to get. This was a simple real life example, to teach the learners, that, coding entails giving computer/s instructions on what we want them to do. Inevitably, if we give them wrong instructions, they will give us incorrect output.\n\nThe learners were afforded the opportunity to be hands on, in the learning process. They were expected to do their practical coding activity while the instructor was busy teaching them. This did not become much of a hurdle for the learners, even though they had no programming experience. Because, there were more than enough professionals and facilitators to help them understand what they had to do.\n\nOverall, the event was a great success! The learners received certificates, as proof that they were part of the training. They were ecstatic! The joy of knowing how to code, was written all over their faces. Indeed, such training should not be done only during Africa Code Week. There should be more of these, because coding is an important skill, in the digital era.\n",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "Most of the learners said they would love to do more activities that involve hands on programming.",

It was dedicated to beginners to understand how a website is built, to discover HTML&CSS, and to code their very first webpage.\nEquipment: \n\u2013 HTML printed cubes\n\u2013 computers\n\u2013 internet connexion (if not, prepare a folder with text and images for part 3)\n\nThe workshop was made up of three parts (1 hour 30 minutes):\n1) \u2018HTML Puzzle Game: introduction to HTML tags\u2019\nThe participants build a basic webpage structure with HTML puzzle cubes. \nThis starting point aims to make them familiar with the HTML tags, to demistify code behind a webpage and make it more accessible.\nManipulating tangible items helps to understand, memorise and make code more concrete.\nIt's always a collaborative and joyful moment.\nThey keep this puzzle structure in front of them for the next steps.\n2) \u2018Modify and play with the code of a web page with Mozilla Thimble\u2019\nBy using Mozilla Thimble and remixing a project, participants modify existing HTML and CSS pages.\nThis second part aims to reassure the participants by modifying content of existing files, without being afraid of creating new files from scratch and linking them to each other.\n3) \u2018Code your first web page on your own with a Text Editor\u2019\nParticipants use what they have learned in the two first parts to code by their own.\nWithin a text editor and looking at the HTML puzzle cubes structure, participants first write the HTML structure. Then they add content (title, paragraph, image, link). \nFinally they create an external CSS stylesheet and link it to the HTML file to apply CSS properties to the content. \nThey regularly refresh their HTML page in the browser to see how it evolves. \nThis part aims to make participant more confident about coding and summarize what they have discovered and learned during the workshop.\nAlways congratulate the participants for coding their very first webpage!\n\n(You can organize separately these workshops, depending on the available time and your participants.)\n",
        "Feedback from Attendees": "The very beginners were pleased and reassured by being able to code by their own without any coding knowledge.\nThe participants who had a few HTML & CSS knowledge rediscovered what they had learned and were more confident to code with a instructor.",

        "Event Description": "Art & Code- exploring how artists you code to express themselves\nWe started out this year drawing spirals with pixels. Exploring many possibilities with Scratch, ScratchX & Leap Motion, Beetle Blocks. Whilst playing a Sonic Pi programmed soundscape we opened Chrome Music Lab\u2019s Spectrogram to see what the visualisation looked like.\nWhat if we programmed our own sound responsive visuals by tinkering with our original Scratch drawing sketch?\nThese sound generated drawings were introduced at EU Code Week.\n\nOur listening journey led us to Processing.\n\n\u201cProcessing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. generated sketches transformed into laser cut stencils.\u201d\n\nIn Processing we tinkered with basic drawing sketches to produce art that would have a visual impact in an outdoor environment. These ideas led from printing t-shirts to designing laser-cut stencils- inspired by a Mozfest space, DIY Activist Art with@drewSaysGoVeg.\nFrom coded drawings we created jpeg images which were vectorised in 2D Design software in preparation for laser cutting.\n\nFollowing an intense discussion about artist intention and colour effect we made plans to spray our work in an underground carpark.\nDIY Activist Art\n\nOur final session of the year saw our coded 2D stencils evolve into mono prints. Allowing us to compare media from spray can to acrylic applied with a roller.\n\nAs we dive deeper into a world of art & code, driven by a passion for creativity in education, web literacy and open practices.",

        "Feedback from Attendees": "\"I believe I have control over information that I share on the web\" This was a hard topic to discuss as most of the attendees were skeptical about this i.e they were somewhere in between because they were not sure of the application they have been using like WhatSapp, Messenger etc. Also on the browsers been used, how secured it is to use it to access the web. But there was this one person who stood out to say she can have control over what information she shares on the web i.e She does not join any application without reading the terms and conditions or any softwares created. This got people thinking and it was a topic to be discussed on, eventually everyone came to a conclusion that one can have control of the information shared on the web by reading the terms and conditions of every software and also to be careful when sharing private informations on-line and also to be aware of how cookies can be used to monitor one.

        "Your Feedback": "This was an interesting discussion as it got everyone participating and debating on the topic. Why one should know more about on-line privacy and security and how essential it is as most people are not aware of all this therefore disadvantaged. Almost everyone is using the web now and in the next million years to come, so one should be aware of how to use the web in an inclusive and engaging way. How we should treat kids' information differently than adults, how cookies and third parties trackers monitors one as he/she go about his/hers everyday task on the web, Why one should read the terms and conditions of softwares or applications installed and also why you should not share confidential information over the web, and how companies and organizations track and collect your data on-line. Therefore learning how to safeguard your privacy on-line and developing an awareness to all of these listed about is something we should all take note of. ",
